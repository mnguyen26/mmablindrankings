# MMA Blind Rankings

A game where you will rank MMA fighters when presented with all choices at once and then when given the choices one at a time.

## How to play

(https://mnguyen26.github.io/mmablindrankings/)

Screen 1: You'll receive ten random fighters to rank based on their career peaks (not current ability). Click a fighter to select them and then click a slot to rank them at that position. 

Screen 2: You'll also rank ten fighters but you'll see them one by one, ranking each as they appear. You won't know who's coming next, and you can't adjust previous rankings. Click at the top to stop the randomizer and then click a slot to rank the chosen fighter at that position.

After each round your rankings will be scored based on how well they matched the order of "career peaks" measured by fighters' Elo scores . While it might seem harder to rank fighters without knowing who's next, most people's “blind” rankings shouldn't be that much less accurate.

This game highlights a common challenge: making choices with limited information. In our actual lives we have to do this all the time because we rarely get to see all our options at once; for example, picking a partner or a career path. We usually have to go through each option one at a time without knowing the quality of future choices. When making these decisions we try to aim for "local maximums". We have to make decisions and choose among only the options we've encountered so far without any certainty if something better will come later on. As difficult as this might seem, people are still able to make good choices even with such constraints. Our minds intuitively estimate risk and we have to subconsciously make decisions like these every day without deliberate thought.

### 

The "true" rankings of fighters are based on their "peak Elo" throughout their career in the UFC. All UFC fights were scraped from Tapology and fighter Elo scores were tracked throughout fighters' careers. Slight modifications were made to weigh finishes more than decisions when adjusting scores. Every fighter that has fought in the UFC has a "peak score" at some point in their career and the "true" rankings are based on these scores. In general, the quantitative rankings mostly match my eye test and conventional "GOAT lists" by the MMA community. In a few cases they go against the conventional narrative that most people hold for a particular fighter but when you look more closely at who a fighter has beaten and who they've lost to and how that has affected their Elo at certain points in their career, it's easy to see how we over-value some fighters and under-value others.
