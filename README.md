# MMA Blind Rankings

A game where you'll rank MMA fighters, first with all choices visible at once, and then with options presented one at a time.

## Overview

In MMA Blind Rankings, test your ability to rank fighters based on their career peaks—first with full visibility of choices and then by ranking fighters one-by-one without knowing who's next. This game challenges you to make the best decisions with incomplete information.

## How to play

Screen 1: You’ll see ten random fighters. Rank them based on their career peaks (not current ability) by clicking a fighter to select them and then clicking a slot to place them in that position.

Screen 2: You’ll rank ten fighters one-by-one. Each fighter appears in random order, and you won’t know who’s coming next. You cannot adjust previous rankings. Click at the top to stop the randomizer and then click a slot to rank the chosen fighter.

After both rounds, your rankings are scored based on how closely they align with fighters’ "career peak" Elo scores. While ranking blind may seem harder, most people’s "blind" rankings shouldn't be that much less accurate.

This game highlights the common challenge of making choices with limited information. In our actual lives we have to do this all the time because we rarely get to see all our options at once; for example, picking a partner or a career path. We usually have to go through each option one at a time without knowing the quality of future choices. When making these decisions we try to aim for "local maximums" since there is a degree of uncertainty of something better coming later on. As difficult as this might seem, people are still able to make good choices even with such constraints. Our minds intuitively estimate risk and we have to subconsciously make decisions like these every day without deliberate thought.

### 

The "true" fighter rankings in this game are based on their "peak Elo" scores throughout their UFC careers. All UFC fights were scraped from Tapology, and Elo scores were tracked throughout each fighter’s career. Slight modifications were were made to the algorithm to give more weight to finishes over decisions. Fighters’ peak scores generally align with my own eye test and with community rankings and GOAT lists as well, though a few challenge conventional views. In these cases, closer analysis of who each fighter defeated (or lost to) reveals how we may overvalue or undervalue certain fighters.
